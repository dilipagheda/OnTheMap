# iOS App - On the Map

This is an iOS App which allows user to authenticate with Udacity and post location and user information. App will then show these data interactively on the map using Map View 
and also on the table view.

This app is such a fun way to interact with geolocation data using ios MapView.

# Skills applied
I built this app using below: 

- UI Components - MapKit, ImageView, Vertical StackView, Button etc.
- API Integration - App integrates with udacity backend
- Authentication - App allows user to login and once login is successful, it will segue to landing view.
- Design Pattern - MVC
  
I have constructed a seperate classes for Model, ViewController and Services. All networking code is encapsulated as part of services classes.

Note: Swift 5 and xCode version 13.2.1 is used.
